# NumberDetectionJava
First ever java project made in my first year at EPFL in 2018.

Little java program that recognizes manuscript numbers based on a set of numbers in a dataset.
Can't upload the 5000_per_digit-image-train file, but you can use other data sets to train the program.

Just launch the KNN file and enter the number of images wanted (X x Y images) and let it do its work.
